/**
 * Per-session cache-liveness state for the history collapse.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The history grid is append-only: chunk N's pixels are a pure function of its
 * message range, so old chunks stay byte-identical as the conversation grows and
 * ride Anthropic's prompt cache as `cache_read` forever. That freeze is worth a
 * lot — but only while a cache actually exists. Where there is none, the freeze
 * protects nothing and the grid is free to be re-cut for *density* instead:
 * {@link HistoryCollapseOptions.packFill} raises the freeze step until the pages
 * are nearly full, which roughly halves image tokens on long sessions of short
 * turns (#161: 317 images at 43% fill).
 *
 * ## How we know whether a cache exists
 *
 * The provider tells us, and that beats inferring it. {@link noteCacheOutcome}
 * feeds each response's accounting back in: a `cache_read` proves the prefix was
 * live, a `cache_create` proves one was just written. Only when both are zero is
 * there nothing to lose by re-cutting.
 *
 * This module used to decide from the wall clock alone, treating any gap past the
 * ephemeral 5-minute TTL as cold. That was wrong most of the times it fired —
 * measured over 143 gaps on a production host, the cache was still warm in 66% of
 * gaps past 5.5 minutes, 40% past 15 minutes, 13% past an hour. Claude Code marks
 * some blocks with the 1-hour TTL, so the short constant never described this
 * traffic. The worst case was a session repacked three times in one hour on
 * ~10-minute gaps, each repack re-keying the whole prefix — and each preceded by a
 * turn that had just *written* a cache, which the clock could not see.
 *
 * The clock survives only as a backstop for responses whose accounting never
 * arrived: {@link COLD_HORIZON_MS}. And a rejected request still marks the session
 * dead outright ({@link markCacheDead}) — but only a 413 or a too-long 400, not
 * a transient 5xx: see {@link responseLeftNoCache}.
 *
 * ## Why the step is sticky
 *
 * Once a session has been repacked coarse, every later turn must keep at least
 * that step. Falling back to the fine grid would re-cut the same messages into
 * different chunks — every chunk's bytes change, and the whole history re-keys as
 * `cache_create`. {@link recordFreezeStep} pins the floor; the collapse only ever
 * doubles it.
 *
 * ## Why the state survives a restart
 *
 * The map lives in this process. A restart used to lose it, and the module
 * called that an accepted failure mode: an unknown session is treated as WARM
 * (no repack), so at worst we keep paying the old image count. That covers
 * `cold`, but not the floor. {@link recordFreezeStep} exists because a render at
 * a finer grid than the session was last frozen at re-keys every chunk (see
 * above), and after a restart the floor is 0 again: the next collapse is free to
 * pick a finer step than the one the cache was built on, and whether it does
 * depends on that request's image budget — exactly what the pin was added to
 * stop mattering.
 *
 * So the host may attach a {@link SessionStateStore}. Every mutation schedules a
 * debounced save ({@link PERSIST_DEBOUNCE_MS}); the record shape on disk is the
 * in-memory record plus its key. On configure the file is read back and records
 * idle for more than {@link PERSIST_MAX_IDLE_MS} are dropped — past the cold
 * horizon the clock already declares them cold, so nothing they pin is protecting
 * a live cache. Records already in memory win over the file. The core never
 * touches a filesystem: without a store the module behaves exactly as before.
